Data set that covers information about apps available on the Apple Store
First we identify the stakeholder; in this case is an aspiring app developer who needs data driven insights to decide what type of app to build
Regular questions: what app categories are most popular, what price should i set, and how can i maximize user ratings
Next step; exploratory data analysis (Eda)
Final recommendations:
Paid apps have better ratings
Apps supporting between 10-30 languages have better ratings
Finance and book apps have low ratings
Apps with a longer description have better ratings
Games and enterteinment have high competition
